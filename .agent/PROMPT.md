# TEST TASK: "Launch Plan", the core of a Minecraft launcher, proven by tests

Work ONLY in this new scratch repo: Atlas-ultra. Never touch my other repos. Obey AGENTS.md. No local builds: all builds run in GitHub Actions.

## Goal
A pure Kotlin/JVM module `:core` that turns a Minecraft Java version id (plus an optional Fabric loader) into a complete, verified LAUNCH PLAN, using LIVE Mojang and Fabric data. Then one small Compose screen shows it.

## Part A: `:core` (the hard part)
Input: version id, optional Fabric loader version, target platform linux-arm64 (what Android launchers run on). Output:
1. Download list: client jar, libraries, native libraries, asset objects. Each with url, SHA1, size, destination path.
2. Classpath (ordered, no duplicate artifacts) and main class.
3. Complete JVM + game argument lists with every ${placeholder} resolved, or explicitly reported as unresolved.
4. Required Java major version.
5. Asset layout (modern hashed layout or legacy/virtual, whichever the version needs).
Inspect the real JSON from the official endpoints (find and cite them). Don't guess schemas.
Assume all version JSONs use the same modern `arguments` format. (Client assumption: verify it, don't trust it.)
Fabric: merge the loader's profile into the vanilla plan correctly. Decide and document how conflicting duplicate libraries are resolved.
Decide and document what happens when a version has no natives for the target platform. Never skip silently.
Don't use "ManifestResolverKit" unless you verify it exists, is maintained and fits. Report what you found.
Tests (JUnit): recorded real fixtures committed with their fetch date, plus ONE live smoke test. Cover at least: one pre-1.13 version, one 1.13-1.20 version, the latest release, one snapshot, one old alpha/beta, and Fabric on a version of your choice. CI must run `./gradlew :core:test` and show the results.

## Part B: one screen
Shows the resolved plan for a chosen version as stages (Libraries, Natives, Assets, Fabric) with real counts and byte totals, plus a REAL dry-run of verifying/downloading into the app cache with true progress. Material 3 Expressive only. Write `.agent/DESIGN.md` first. Own motion tokens, one purposeful state-morph (idle -> running -> done/failed), reduced motion respected. States: running, failed (which file, why), done. No placeholder data, no extra screens or features.

## Process
1. Ask me up to 3 questions in ONE message about anything truly ambiguous, or state your assumptions. Then wait.
2. `.agent/` files: PROMPT, GOAL (in/out of scope), PLAN, DESIGN, RESEARCH (URLs), LOG, FAILURES.
3. First push = diagnostic workflow only (`./gradlew help`). Max 8 full CI runs. Read the FIRST error with `gh run view --log-failed`. The 2-strike rule applies.
4. Final report: what you verified (with evidence), what you didn't, and what in the real data contradicted the assumptions I gave you.

## User Answers to Questions

**Q1: JVM Version** → "Your call. Pick the JVM target that fits the latest stable Android Gradle Plugin and Kotlin requirements, use the same JDK in CI, and record the choice and your reasoning in RESEARCH.md with sources."

**Q2: Build Setup** → "Kotlin DSL is fine. Do NOT choose versions from memory: use the latest stable Gradle, Kotlin, AGP and KSP/Compose plugins, verified from real repository metadata, with source URLs in RESEARCH.md. All builds run in GitHub Actions only, no local builds. Run git init in this folder, then create a NEW public GitHub repo named atlas-ultra with gh (use the token from the environment, never print or commit it), and push there. No other repo may be touched."

**Q3: Compose Target** → "Android. Make an :app Android module (Jetpack Compose, minSdk 26) that depends on :core, which stays a pure Kotlin/JVM module. Everything else: your best judgment, documented. Proceed."
